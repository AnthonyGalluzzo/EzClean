# EzClean
# A package that allows the user to simplify the data cleaning process, making it more accessible and efficient for data analysts and scientists.
# The reason that I wanted to create this package was to improve the lives of data scientist and analyist. That's is why I created functions that allow the user to insert a data set and return a clean version to help save time. I also made some functions to help reformat some areas like the date to help make them more readiable to the users. Manipulating data can take a lot of time and effort, so I wanted to help reduce the mundane work some data scientist and analysit can get to the harder coding faster.
